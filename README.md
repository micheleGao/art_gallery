# Art Gallery
The beauty of art is in the eye of the beholder.

## Description of Art Gallery
A website to enjoy the beauty of art. There's a Homepage, a Gallery, and About page. All photos were sourced from HarvardArtMuseum.org


 #### This project was deployed to netlify, heres the link: https://artgallerymg.netlify.app


### Inspiration  for the project
I have always loved art, and being able to pull data from an API with art and using React seemed like a great idea for the modularity of the contents and be able to display the content accordingly to the way I imagined. 



## Wireframing of the components

## My MVP Goals
- To have at least one API
- To useContext for the data 
- Media Responsive
- Use react-Bootsrap


## Stretch Goals
- Using a second API for another gallery page
- Displaying the information of the photos/art displayed

### Complications during the project
-Using useContext()
-Harvard Art Museum API
-The useEffect in the useContext


## Technologies Used.
1. Javascript
2. React
3. CSS
4. React-router-dom
5. React-Bootstrap

## Getting started.
1.Fork 
2. Clone down the repo.
3. Once it’s in your remote repository, cd into the file (make sure you're in the react file). Install dependencies.
4. Yarn add react-bootstrap. 
5. Yarn add react-router-dom.
6. Once you have the dependencies on the forked and clone version in your remote repository, run Yarn start. 
 -If you notice, your package.json file should have all the dependencies and their versions listed under the dependencies.
 -Another thing you can notice is that  your file should have a yarn.lock, and  the node modules. 
 -You should be set to go after these.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
